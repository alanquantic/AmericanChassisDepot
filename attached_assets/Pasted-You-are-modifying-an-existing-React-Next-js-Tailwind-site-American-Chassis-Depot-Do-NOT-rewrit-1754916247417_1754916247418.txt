You are modifying an existing React/Next.js + Tailwind site (American Chassis Depot). 
Do NOT rewrite or change any visible copy/text, product names, routes, or slugs. 
The goal is a more modern UI, English as default language, and two new UI sections.

GOALS
1) Keep all current text content EXACTLY as-is. Only update layout/styling and components.
2) Default language must be English. If i18n exists, set defaultLocale:'en' and keep 'es' active.
3) Modernize the Home page: full-bleed HERO with video, glass card quote form, flat product cards, and a brands marquee.

TECH & CONSTRAINTS
- Keep the current color palette inspired by the US flag: blue #0A3161, red #B22234, white.
- Tailwind CSS is the styling baseline. No additional UI libs.
- Accessibility: proper contrast, keyboard focus, and prefers-reduced-motion for animations.
- Performance: LCP < 2.5s. Use next/image for images; serve hero video in webm+mp4 with poster fallback.

TASKS (Home only)
A) HERO (replace background image with video)
   - Add /public/videos/hero.mp4 and /public/videos/hero.webm (use placeholders if needed).
   - Implement <video autoplay muted loop playsInline> with a dark gradient overlay (blue/red) for readable white text.
   - Left column: reuse the existing H1, paragraph and CTAs from the current hero (do not change text).
   - Right column: keep the existing quote form, wrap it in a translucent glass card (backdrop-blur, white/90, rounded-2xl).
   - Mobile: form stacks below hero copy; CTAs remain.

B) BRANDS MARQUEE (new section under hero)
   - Section title: reuse any existing “brands/components” heading if present; otherwise keep the section title minimal and do NOT change global copy elsewhere.
   - Add a horizontal marquee of component brands (logos or text pills) such as: SAF-HOLLAND, Hendrickson, Meritor, JOST, WABCO, Bendix, Alcoa, Michelin, TSE Brakes, Firestone.
   - Implement as an infinite, seamless scroll with tailwind keyframes; pause on hover; respect prefers-reduced-motion (show static grid if reduced).
   - Add placeholder SVGs in /public/brands/*.svg if logo assets are missing.

C) FEATURED PRODUCTS (refresh styles only)
   - Keep the same product data and labels (“New/Used”, “In stock”, buttons).
   - Visual style: flat cards (no hard borders), subtle shadow on hover, 16:9 media area, clean badges (red for New, blue for Used).
   - Primary button = red (#B22234) “Get a Quote”; secondary outline “View details”.
   - No text changes.

D) BENEFITS / COVERAGE / TESTIMONIALS / FOOTER
   - Keep the same content; update spacing, rounded corners, and micro-interactions to match the new style.
   - Maintain US-inspired accents (subtle stripes/stars backgrounds at low opacity).

FILE CHANGES (suggested)
- app/(or pages)/page.tsx: compose new Home layout using the new components below.
- components/Hero.tsx: video hero + glass quote form (reusing existing form component).
- components/LogoMarquee.tsx: marquee with brands; fall back to a static grid on reduced motion.
- components/ProductCard.tsx: flat card variant; keep existing props and text.
- styles/globals.css (or app/globals.css): add marquee keyframes and utility classes.
- public/videos/hero.mp4, hero.webm, poster.jpg (placeholder ok).
- public/brands/*.svg for brand logos (placeholders ok).

TAILWIND HELPERS
Add to globals.css:
@keyframes marquee { 0% { transform: translateX(0); } 100% { transform: translateX(-50%); } }
.marquee { animation: marquee 30s linear infinite; }
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { .marquee { animation: none; } }

I18N (only if present): in next.config.js ensure:
i18n: { locales: ['en','es'], defaultLocale: 'en' }

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- All existing texts remain unchanged.
- Home shows a looping hero video with readable overlay and the unchanged quote form in a glass card.
- A brands marquee (or static grid when reduced motion) appears under the hero.
- Product cards look flatter, with hover elevation and correct badges/colors.
- No route or slug changes. Build passes, Lighthouse LCP <= 2.5s on desktop.

After implementing, run the dev server and show me the updated Home. Commit as:
chore(ui): modern home with video hero, brands marquee, flat product cards, EN default
